# Basic Shell Implementation and Process Management 

#### REPORT : [  - :notebook_with_decorative_cover:  PDF ](/reports/1.pdf)
---
In this deliverable, you will implement a basic shell that: 

-  Accepts and executes user commands. 
- Implements built-in shell commands such as cd, pwd, exit, echo, clear, ls, cat, mkdir, rmdir, rm, touch, and kill. 
- Manages foreground and background execution of commands using system calls like fork(), exec(), wait(), and exit(). 
- Tracks the status of running processes and provides basic job control.

## Specific Commands and Utilities to Implement: 


### 1. Built-in Commands: 
- cd [directory]: Change the current working directory. 
- pwd: Print the current working directory. 
- exit: Terminate the shell. 
- echo [text]: Print the specified text to the terminal. 
- clear: Clear the terminal screen. 
- ls: List the files in the current directory. 
- cat [filename]: Display the contents of a file. 
- mkdir [directory]: Create a new directory. 
- rmdir [directory]: Remove an empty directory. 
- rm [filename]: Remove a file. 
- touch [filename]: Create an empty file or update the timestamp of an existing file. 
- kill [pid]: Terminate a process by its Process ID. 


### 2. Process Management and Job Control: 
- Support foreground and background execution of commands. 
- Implement basic job control commands: 
jobs: List all background jobs. 
    - fg [job_id]: Bring a background job to the foreground. 
    - bg [job_id]: Resume a stopped job in the background.

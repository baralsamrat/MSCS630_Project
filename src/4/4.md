- **Piping Functionality:**  
  A terminal screenshot showing commands like `ls | grep txt` and `cat file | grep error | sort`, with output confirming that piping works correctly.
  
- **User Authentication:**  
  Screenshots of the login interface where different user credentials (admin and standard) are used, illustrating successful login and access control.
  
- **File Permissions:**  
  Examples of file operations where permission restrictions are enforced (e.g., a standard user attempting to modify a system file results in an error).

## 1. Introduction

This deliverable marks the culmination of our custom shell project. In this final phase, we integrated process management, scheduling, memory management, and process synchronization features from earlier deliverables into a unified shell environment. In addition, we have added advanced functionalities—command piping and robust security mechanisms—to further simulate a Unix-like operating system.

## 2. Code Submission

- **Source Code:**  
  - **Process Management & Job Control:** Implementation of built-in commands (cd, ls, cat, etc.), foreground/background process execution, and job control (jobs, fg, bg).
  - **Process Scheduling:** Both Round-Robin (with configurable time slices) and Priority-Based Scheduling algorithms are implemented.
  - **Memory Management:** A simulated paging system with FIFO and LRU page replacement algorithms.
  - **Process Synchronization:** Solutions to classical problems (e.g., Producer-Consumer) using mutexes/semaphores.
  - **Piping & Security:** New modules for command piping and security (user authentication and file permissions).

## 3. Piping Implementation

- **Functionality:**  
  The shell supports command piping, allowing the output of one command to serve as the input for another. For example, the command `ls | grep txt` lists all files and then filters the output to show only those containing “txt” in their name.
  
- **Technical Approach:**  
  - The shell’s parser splits the input command by the pipe (`|`) delimiter.
  - For each command segment, the shell creates a new process.
  - Using inter-process communication (e.g., the `pipe()` system call in C/C++ or `subprocess.Popen` in Python), file descriptors are connected so that the standard output of one process is redirected to the standard input of the next.
  - This approach supports chaining multiple commands (e.g., `cat file | grep error | sort`) seamlessly.
  
- **Key Challenges:**  
  - Managing multiple file descriptors and ensuring they are properly closed after use.
  - Handling errors when one of the piped commands fails, ensuring robust error reporting and graceful termination.

## 4. Security Mechanisms

### User Authentication

- **Implementation:**  
  - The shell requires users to log in before access is granted.
  - A simple authentication system is implemented where users provide a username and password.
  - The system simulates multiple user roles (e.g., **admin** and **standard user**).  
  - Credentials are verified against a stored set of user records, and session states are maintained for further command executions.
  
- **Security Features:**  
  - Prevents unauthorized access to the shell.
  - Demonstrates role-based access control—only users with administrative privileges can execute sensitive system modifications.

### File Permissions

- **Implementation:**  
  - The shell simulates Unix-like file permission handling by associating each file with read, write, and execute permissions.
  - Users are restricted based on their role: for example, standard users are prevented from modifying system files.
  
- **Operational Details:**  
  - Before any file operation (e.g., modifying or deleting a file), the shell checks the user’s permission level.
  - If a user lacks the necessary permissions, an appropriate error message is displayed, simulating a real file-system permission error.

## 5. Integration Overview

- **Unified Architecture:**  
  All components from previous deliverables have been integrated into a single shell environment. This includes:
  - **Process Management:** Enabling the execution of built-in and external commands.
  - **Process Scheduling:** Allowing both Round-Robin and Priority-Based scheduling to simulate real OS process handling.
  - **Memory Management:** Simulating paging, page faults, and replacement strategies (FIFO and LRU).
  - **Process Synchronization:** Preventing race conditions via mutexes/semaphores and solving classic problems like Producer-Consumer.
  
- **Module Interactions:**  
  - Piped commands share the same underlying process management and scheduling systems.
  - Security checks (authentication and file permissions) are enforced across all modules, ensuring that even processes spawned via piping respect user access levels.

## 7. Challenges and Improvements

- **Integration Challenges:**  
  - Merging multiple OS simulation components into a single shell required careful coordination to avoid conflicts, especially when managing concurrent processes.
  - Implementing piping in a way that preserved the security context for each command process was nontrivial.
  
- **How Challenges Were Addressed:**  
  - Modular design and clear API boundaries between components allowed each module to be developed and tested independently.
  - Extensive error handling and logging were introduced to diagnose issues during inter-process communication.
  
- **Future Improvements:**  
  - Enhance security by integrating encryption for stored credentials.
  - Optimize the scheduling algorithms to better simulate real-world scenarios.
  - Expand the piping functionality to handle redirection and complex command hierarchies.

## 8. Conclusion

The final deliverable successfully integrates all previous project components into a fully functional shell. With advanced features like command piping and comprehensive security mechanisms, the shell not only simulates key operating system functionalities but also provides a robust environment that mimics real-world access controls and process management. The challenges encountered during integration were met with modular design choices and careful error handling, laying the groundwork for further enhancements in future iterations.

# Process Scheduling

#### REPORT : [  - :notebook_with_decorative_cover: PDF ](/reports/2.pdf)

## Introduction
This deliverable enhances the shell by implementing **process scheduling** using:
1. **Round-Robin Scheduling** (time-sharing with a fixed quantum).
2. **Priority-Based Scheduling with Preemption** (highest-priority process executes first).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Round-Robin Scheduling
- Each process receives a **user-configurable** time slice (quantum).
- If the process does not complete in its slice, it is moved to the end of the queue.
- Uses `time.sleep()` to simulate execution.

### 2. Priority-Based Scheduling with Preemption
- Processes are assigned priorities (lower number = higher priority).
- The highest-priority process **runs first**.
- If two processes have the same priority, First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) applies.
- If a higher-priority process arrives while a lower-priority process is running, **preemption occurs**, and the higher-priority process takes over.

### 3. Performance Analysis
#### Metrics Measured:
- **Waiting Time**: The time a process waits before execution.
- **Turnaround Time**: Total time from arrival to completion.
- **Response Time**: Time from arrival to first execution.

#### Observations:
- **Round-Robin Scheduling** ensures fairness but may increase turnaround time.
- **Priority-Based Scheduling** minimizes waiting time for high-priority processes but can lead to starvation of lower-priority ones.

## Challenges and Improvements

-  ![Evidence 2](/analysis/2/priority_scheduling_execution.png)
-  ![Evidence 3](/analysis/2/round_robin_execution.png)

- **Challenge**: Managing preemption in priority scheduling.
  - **Solution**: Used a **priority queue** (`heapq`) for efficient scheduling.
- **Challenge**: Fair process execution in Round-Robin.
  - **Solution**: Introduced **user-configurable quantum switching**.

## Conclusion
The shell now simulates **process scheduling**, mimicking OS process management. This lays the groundwork for future enhancements like **memory management and synchronization**.

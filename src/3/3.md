This project simulates two key operating system functionalities:

1. **Memory Management Simulation**:

   - Implements a paging system.
   - Demonstrates page faults and two page replacement algorithms: FIFO and an optimized LRU (using OrderedDict).

2. **Process Synchronization Simulation**:
   - Implements the classic Producer-Consumer problem.
   - Uses semaphores and a mutex to synchronize access to a shared buffer.

## File Structure

- **main.py**: Main Python script containing the simulation code.
- **3.md**: This file with instructions and an overview. Detailed report on the implementation, challenges, and performance analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running the Simulation

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Set execute permission for `run.sh`:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

## 1. Memory Management Simulation

### Overview

The memory management simulation models a simple paging system. Each process is allocated pages within a fixed number of frames. The simulation handles:

- **Page Faults**: Occur when a process requests a page not currently loaded.
- **Page Replacement**: Invoked when memory is full.

Two algorithms are implemented:

- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Replaces the oldest loaded page.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Optimized using an OrderedDict for efficient updates; replaces the least recently used page.

### Simulation Details

- **Allocation & Replacement**:
  - When a process requests a page:
    - If already in memory, it updates (for LRU) and no fault occurs.
    - Otherwise, a page fault is logged.
    - If memory is full, a page is replaced based on the selected algorithm.
- **Tracking**:
  - The simulation maintains per-process page lists and counts page faults.

### Comparison with Real Systems

Real operating systems use complex mechanisms (e.g., hardware support, virtual memory) for paging. This simulation abstracts those details to focus on core concepts.

## 2. Process Synchronization Simulation

### Overview

The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization challenge:

- **Producers** add items to a shared buffer.
- **Consumers** remove items from the buffer.

### Implementation Details

- **Semaphores**:
  - `empty`: Tracks available buffer slots.
  - `full`: Tracks the number of filled slots.
- **Mutex**:
  - A lock ensures that only one thread accesses the buffer at a time, preventing race conditions.

### How Race Conditions are Prevented

- **Mutual Exclusion**:  
  The mutex guarantees that only one thread accesses the critical section (buffer manipulation).
- **Signaling**:  
  Semaphores coordinate producer and consumer actions, ensuring proper buffer usage.

## 3. Challenges and Improvements

### Challenges

- **Efficient LRU Tracking**:
  - Initially, tracking access times using timestamps led to O(n) operations.
  - Using an OrderedDict reduced this to O(1) per update.
- **Thread Coordination**:
  - Proper synchronization to avoid deadlocks in the Producer-Consumer problem was critical.

### Potential Improvements

- **Dynamic Simulation**:
  - Extend the simulation to support dynamic process creation and varying page sizes.
- **Additional Synchronization Problems**:
  - Implement other classical problems (e.g., Dining Philosophers) for broader demonstration.
- **Enhanced Metrics**:
  - Include detailed logging for performance metrics such as total execution time and replacement counts.

## 4. Conclusion

This project effectively demonstrates essential operating system concepts: memory management (paging with FIFO and optimized LRU) and process synchronization (Producer-Consumer). The simulation provides insight into how these mechanisms ensure system stability and performance.
